# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis
* The overview of the analysis is to determine how reviews of the amazon vine program influence in star ratings in contrast of non vine program reviews. We used a database to retrieve big data through the AWS RDS program to load large amount of data and transforming it in a cloud based notebook of Google to show our results of our analysis. We ended up sending our results to PGAdmin for table creations and also using the google notebook to get instant transformed results.

# Results

## How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

* Total of 94 vine reviews
* Total of 40471 non vine reviews

## How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

* Total of 48 vine reviews
* total of 15663 non vine reviews
## What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
* Percentage of 51.06% of Vine reviews were 5 stars
* Percentage of 38.70% of non vine reviews were 5 stars

# Summary 

* By Looking at the numbers, it does look it is a biased analysis as non vine reviews have almost the same percentage of 5 star reviews with their respective total of reviews. If I were them, I would analyze the videogames that have a count higher than x amount of unpaid vine  reviews + paid vine reviews to determine if the bias comes fromt the whole dataset or specific videogames.
